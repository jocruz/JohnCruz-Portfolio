      <p class="portfolio-description">
        As part of my continuous self-development in cybersecurity, I have
        undertaken a comprehensive course with TCM Security to study Web
        Application Penetration Testing. 
      </p>
      <p class="portfolio-description">
        This motivated me to leverage my coding skills in Python to develop
        various scripts that not only demonstrate my coding ability but also
        enhance my understanding of security vulnerabilities.
