            üöÄ About Me Hello! I'm John, a dynamic freelance software developer
            and security enthusiast from Brooklyn, NYC. Graduated from Stony
            Brook University in Information Systems Engineering, I've dived deep
            into the realms of Web 3 and cybersecurity. As a tech wizard, I'm
            currently channeling my skills into freelance projects with Moverz a
            start up based in Long Island, sculpting the future of the internet
            one Web 3 DApp at a time. My journey has spanned roles from
            full-stack development to security, driven by a passion to bridge
            the evolving digital landscapes of Web 2 and Web 3.
          </p>
          <p>
            üåü What I'm Up To I've recently aced my Sec+ 701, and I'm on a quest
            to blend the worlds of security and development. My current projects
            range from integrating Stripe for seamless NFT transactions to
            crafting comprehensive web applications like the Handball Hub.
            Whether it's mentoring budding developers or tackling the next
            security challenge, I'm all about pushing the envelope and preparing
            for the tech shifts on the horizon. Connect with me as I navigate
            the exciting intersection of creation and security, aiming to make a
            significant impact in the tech space.
          </p>

          <p>
            üèÑ In this portfolio, I have three major focuses: Websites and
            projects that I have helped clients with as a freelance
            developer‚Äîthe latest being LI Groupies, where I utilized Stripe and
            Thirdweb to facilitate payments and interact with the EVM
            blockchain. I also showcase my React portfolio through simple React
            projects, and Python scripts that I've worked on as part of my
            self-study in the cybersecurity space, where I've explored the OWASP
            Top 10 and am currently learning about web application penetration
            testing, including XSS, SQL injections, Command OS injections, brute
            force, and much more.
